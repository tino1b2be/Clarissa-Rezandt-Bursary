        <p3>A substantial majority of the South African population have been poverty stricken for a long

            time.  This has inhibited the potential for children to access quality education.  The Clarissa

            Mack and Patrick Rezandt Bursary distinct purpose seeks to invest in individuals coming

            from previously disadvantage backgrounds that have demonstrated the capacity and tenacity

            to overcome huge socio-economic challenges. <br/> <br/> The expectations on successful candidates are

            high thus prospective candidates are required to prove a desire to make an impact to the

            community and to rise above all adversity.  Their academic performance must portray the

            firm belief and commitment to be successful.  Furthermore the family financial situation

            should confirm the need for this bursary. <br/> <br/>

            This bursary seeks to attract candidates who show extraordinary talents, in need of financial

            aid to pursue higher education for a better future.  It aims to ensure equality by building the

            future of South Africa with gifted leaders. <br/><br/> This bursary programme will be awarded for the

            sum of R35 000 per annum.
